Application Highlights: MVC-TECH-BLOG


Description:
I have built a full-stack website that enables users to blog about any topic they desire. The front end is handled by Handlebars, and the backend is managed by an Express server. The websiteâ€™s appearance is enhanced with custom CSS, Bootstrap, and Google Fonts.

How to Run:
To use the website, click on the deployed link below, which will take you to the main page. Here, you can view sample blogs or write your own. To create a blog post, you will need to sign up. Once registered, you will be logged in automatically. As a logged-in user, you can create new blog posts, edit or delete your own posts, and comment on any post.
